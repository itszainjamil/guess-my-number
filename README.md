This is one of the projects of the JavaScript course I did from Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.

You have to guess the hidden number between 1 and 20. 

After each guess, the game will tell you if it was above or below the actual number. 

Once you get the number correct, the screen turns green and you win.
